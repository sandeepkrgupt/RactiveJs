1. Some components we import normally like - react but some in {} like {Component} Why ?
2. Why we use super() , Why inside constructor ?
Ans
To make sure the component is initialized correctly, the first line of this function should be a acall to the parent
constructor method : super(props)

3. What is diff. b/w state inside constructor and outside constructor?

4. React Life Cycle Hook?
