1. what is react Architecture ?

Ans :-
MVVM has four main blocks:

The View?—?UI layer that users interact with,
The ViewController —has access to the ViewModel and handles user input,
The ViewModel?—?has access to the Model and handles business logic,
The Model?—?application data source

View -
The View is the only touching point for a user with your application. 
A user will interact with your View that will trigger ViewController methods depending on events such as mouse movements, key presses etc.

view controller -
reference to the ViewModel. The View is not aware of the ViewModel and it is relying on the ViewController to pass all necessary data and events.
Relation between the ViewController and the ViewModel is one-to-many?—?one ViewController can have references to different ViewModels.

view model -
The ViewModel is a producer who doesn’t care who consumes data; it can be React component, Vue component
Every dependency needed by the ViewModel will be injected through the constructor, thus making it easy to test. 
The ViewModel is interacting directly with the Model and whenever the ViewModel updates it, 
all changes will be automatically reflected back to the View.

Model -
The Model is acting as a data source ie. global store for the application. It composes all data from the network layer, 
databases, services and serve them in a easy way. 
It shouldn’t have any other logic except one that actually updates a model and doesn’t have any side effects.
