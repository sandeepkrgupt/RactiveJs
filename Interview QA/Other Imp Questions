Provider :-
One component that is not part of the MVVM but we’ll use it to glue everything together is called Provider. 
This component will instantiate ViewModel and provide all needed dependency to it. Furthermore, 
instance of the ViewModel is passed through props to the ViewController component. 
Provider should be clean, without any logic as its purpose is just to wire up everything.

Example -
import React from 'react'
import { inject } from 'mobx-react'
import PokemonController from './PokemonController'
import PokemonViewModel from './PokemonViewModel'
import RootStore from '../../models/RootStore'

@inject(RootStore.type.POKEMON_MODEL)
class PokemonProvider extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        const pokemonModel = props[RootStore.type.POKEMON_MODEL]
        this.viewModel = new PokemonViewModel(pokemonModel)
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <PokemonController viewModel={this.viewModel}/>
        )
    }
}

export default PokemonProvider

Note: in the code snippet above, @inject decorator is used to inject all needed dependencies into Provider props.

Higher Order Components (HOC) as solution for dependency injection
Higher Order Components are pretty well explained in post Understanding React Higher-Order Components by Example by Trey Huffine. 
Basically, they are used to share things across application, to reduce code duplication and to group these things in one place to make changes easier.
So, HOCs are great for imitating dependency injection!

Injecting apiService with Higher Order Components
First, we need to create a HOC named withApiService, which is function:

function withApiService (WrappedComponent) {
  class HOC extends React.Component {
    render () {
    const key = this.props.apiKey;
    const apiService = new ApiService({key});
   
    return (
      <WrappedComponent
        {...this.props}
        apiService={apiService}
      />
     );
    }
  }
  return HOC;
}
It takes component to decorate and adds property to inject. 
It’s very important to note that Forecast component now takes apiService from properties:

class Forecast extends Component {
  constructor (props) {
  super(props);
  
  this.apiService = props.apiService;
}
But how to use decorated component? We need to replace component usage in render function with new version.
Before, without DI:

render() {
  const {apiKey, cityId} = this.state;
  
  return (
    <Forecast
      cityId={cityId}
      apiKey={apiKey}
    />
  );
}
After, with DI:

render() {
  const {apiKey, cityId} = this.state;
  const WrappedForecast = withApiService(Forecast);
  
  return (
    <WrappedForecast
      cityId={cityId}
      apiKey={apiKey}
    />
  );
}

Redux-observable :-
This has peer dependencies of rxjs@6.x.x and redux@4.x.x, which will have to be installed as well.

npm install --save redux-observable


Redux-observable is another middleware option that allows you to handle asynchronous logic.
function (action$: Observable<Action>, store: Store): Observable<Action>;
As you can see, it’s first parameter is an Observable containing all the 
actions fired in the application and the second is the store, which can be used to get state directly from the store. 

function loadDataEpic(action$) {
  return action$
    .ofType('LOAD_DATA')
    .switchMap(({ url }) =>
      fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.ok ? response.json() : requestFailedAction())
        .then(result => result.type === 'REQUEST_FAILED' ? result : requestSuccessAction(result))
        .catch(() => requestFailedAction())
    )
}

Hoc
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced
technique in React for reusing component logic

Or in sort
a higher-order component is a function that takes 
a component and returns a new component.

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
