class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
   return (<p>hello</p>)
  }
};
Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.
